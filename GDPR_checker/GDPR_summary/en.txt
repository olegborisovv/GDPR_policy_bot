Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
organisations need to make sure their data collection practices don’t break the law and that they aren’t hiding anything from data subjects.
To remain lawful, you need to have a thorough understanding of the GDPR and its rules for data collection. To remain transparent with data subjects, you should state in your privacy policy the type of data you collect and the reason you’re collecting it.

Purpose limitation
Organisations should only collect personal data for a specific purpose, clearly state what that purpose is, and only collect data for as long as necessary to complete that purpose.
Processing that’s done for archiving purposes in the public interest or for scientific, historical or statistical purposes is given more freedom.

Data minimisation
Organisations must only process the personal data that they need to achieve its processing purposes.
in the event of a data breach, the unauthorised individual will only have access to a limited amount of data. data minimisation makes it easier to keep data accurate and up to date.

Accuracy
The accuracy of personal data is integral to data protection. The GDPR states that every reasonable step must be taken to erase or rectify data that is inaccurate or incomplete.
Individuals have the right to request that inaccurate or incomplete data be erased or rectified within 30 days.

Storage limitation
organisations need to delete personal data when it’s no longer necessary

Integrity and confidentiality
personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.
organisations should encrypt and/or pseudonymise personal data wherever possible, but they should also consider whatever other options are suitable.
