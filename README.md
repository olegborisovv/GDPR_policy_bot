# GDPR_policy_bot

## Installation guide.

Once you have downloaded the repository, you should create a virtual environment and install all requirements (make sure you are in the same directory)
```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After all requirements are installed run
```
python main.py
```

If you are running the above command for the first time, then it might take a while to load the program.

After that you can go to the browser of your choice and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/  (might be different in your case)

Then the website should be loaded and ready to play.
